  <h2>Node.js Events</h2>
<h5>Node.js is perfect for event-driven applications.</h5>
  <h4> Events in Node.js</h4> 
  
  <p>Every action on a computer is an event. Like when a connection is made or a file is opened. <br>
    Objects in Node.js can fire events, like the readStream object fires events when opening and closing a file:
    </p> 
 
 <h4>Sample</h4>
  <div id="code">
    var fs = require('fs'); <br>
  var rs = fs.createReadStream('./demofile.txt'); <br>
  <p>
    rs.on('open', function () { <br>
      console.log('The file is open'); <br>
    });
  </p> <br>
  
  </div>
   
  <h2>Events Module</h2>
  <p>Node.js has a built-in module, called "Events", where you can create-, fire-, and listen for- your own events. <br>
    To include the built-in Events module use the require() method. In addition, all event properties and methods  br
    are an instance of an EventEmitter object. To be able to access these properties and methods, <br> create an EventEmitter object:
    </p>
  <div id="code">
    var events = require('events'); <br>
  <p>
    var eventEmitter = new events.EventEmitter();
  </p>
  </div>
   
  <h3>The EventEmitter Object</h3>
 <p> You can assign event handlers to your own events with the EventEmitter object. <br>
  In the example below we have created a function that will be executed when a "scream" event is fired. <br>
  To fire an event, use the emit() method.</p>
  Example
 <div id="code">
  var events = require('events'); <br>
  var eventEmitter = new events.EventEmitter(); <br>
 
  <br>
 <p> //Create an event handler:</p> <br>
  var myEventHandler = function () { <br>
    console.log('I hear a scream!'); <br>
  } <br>
  <p> <br>
    <p>//Assign the event handler to an event:</p> </p><br>
  eventEmitter.on('scream', myEventHandler); <br>
  <br>
  <p>//Fire the 'scream' event:</p> <br>
  eventEmitter.emit('scream');
</div>
